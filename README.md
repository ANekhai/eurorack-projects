## Eurorack Projects

### Intro
This repo is meant to store various diy eurorack projects I embark on in one place. This includes schematics I've transcribed or developed, stripboard and PCB layouts, front panels for laser cutting (and potentially stenciling).

### Structure

- `stripboard-layouts`: Every project using stripboard will be placed here
    - `base-boards`: Blank boards to use as a base for layouts
    - `kicad-libraries`: These are the KiCAD libraries bundled with VeeCAD. This copy is provided for convenience
    - `mki x erica`: Base directory for any Moritz Klein libraries I lay out
    - `panel-utilities`: Helpful FreeCAD panel component drawings and spreadsheets with Eurorack parameters 
    - `panelizer-macro`: FreeCAD macro to automatically lay out holes for panel components in VeeCAD file
    - `veecad-footprints`: Custom footprints for VeeCAD I made, including pots, jacks, switches, et al.

### Status

I make no guarantees that everything in this repository will work without issues. Proceed at your own risk.

Currently, I am actively working on a few things. My main focus is finishing up some basic modules from Moritz Klein. Once this is done, I plan on finishing some designs I've thought of over the years and build out a Serge system.
